# Ika dApp Kit

The Ika dApp Kit is a set of React components, hooks, and utilities to help you build a dApp for the
Ika ecosystem. Its hooks and components provide an interface for querying data from the Ika
blockchain and connecting to Ika wallets.

### Core Features

Some of the core features of the dApp Kit include:

- Query hooks to get the information your dApp needs
- Automatic wallet state management
- Support for all Ika wallets
- Pre-built React components
- Lower level hooks for custom components

## Install

To use the Ika dApp Kit in your project, run the following command in your project root:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i --save @mysten/dapp-kit @ika-io/ika @tanstack/react-query
```

## Setting up providers

To use the hooks and components in the dApp Kit, wrap your app with the providers shown in the
following example. The props available on the providers are covered in more detail in their
respective pages.

```tsx
import { createNetworkConfig, IkaClientProvider, WalletProvider } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
import { getFullnodeUrl } from '@ika-io/ika/client';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

// Config options for the networks you want to connect to
const { networkConfig } = createNetworkConfig({
	localnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('localnet') },
	mainnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet') },
});
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
	return (
		<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
			<IkaClientProvider networks={networkConfig} defaultNetwork="localnet">
				<WalletProvider>
					<YourApp />
				</WalletProvider>
			</IkaClientProvider>
		</QueryClientProvider>
	);
}
```

## Using UI components to connect to a wallet

The dApp Kit provides a set of flexible UI components that you can use to connect and manage wallet
accounts from your dApp. The components are built on top of
[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) and are customizable.

To use the provided UI components, import the dApp Kit CSS stylesheet into your dApp. For more
information regarding customization options, check out the respective documentation pages for the
components and [themes](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit/themes).

```tsx
import '@mysten/dapp-kit/dist/index.css';
```

## Using hooks to make RPC calls

The dApp Kit provides a set of hooks for making RPC calls to the Ika blockchain. The hooks are thin
wrappers around `useQuery` from `@tanstack/react-query`. For more comprehensive documentation on how
to use these query hooks, check out the
[react-query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/overview).

```tsx
import { useIkaClientQuery } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';

function MyComponent() {
	const { data, isPending, error, refetch } = useIkaClientQuery('getOwnedObjects', {
		owner: '0x123',
	});

	if (isPending) {
		return <div>Loading...</div>;
	}

	return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>;
}
```
