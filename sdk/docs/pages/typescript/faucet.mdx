# Faucet

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

Devnet, Testnet, and local networks include faucets that mint PERA. You can use the Pera TypeScript
SDK to call a network's faucet and provide PERA to the address you provide.

To request PERA from a faucet, import the `requestPeraFromFaucetV0` function from the
`@pera-io/pera/faucet` package to your project.

```typescript
import { getFaucetHost, requestPeraFromFaucetV0 } from '@pera-io/pera/faucet';
```

Use `requestPeraFromFaucetV0` in your TypeScript code to request PERA from the network's faucet.

```typescript
await requestPeraFromFaucetV0({
	host: getFaucetHost('testnet'),
	recipient: <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>,
});
```

<Callout type="info">
	Faucets on Devnet and Testnet are rate limited. If you run the script too many times, you surpass
	the limit and must wait to successfully run it again.
</Callout>
