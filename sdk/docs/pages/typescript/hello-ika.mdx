# Hello Ika

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

This basic example introduces you to the Ika TypeScript SDK. The Node.js example mints IKA on a Ika
network and then queries the address to get a sum for the owned IKA. You don't need to use an IDE to
complete the example, but one like Microsoft Visual Studio Code helps centralize more advanced
projects.

## Before you begin

You need an address on a Ika development network (Devnet, Testnet, local). If you don't already have
an address, use the [Ika Client CLI](https://docs.ika.io/references/cli/client) or the
[Ika Wallet browser extension](https://docs.mystenlabs.com) to create one.

You also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) and a package manager like
[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to follow this example, so install them on your system if you
haven't already.

## Start a project

Using a Terminal or Console, create a folder on your system (`hello-ika` in this example) and make
it the working directory.

```sh
mkdir hello-ika
cd hello-ika
```

When you use a package manager to install the necessary packages, it downloads the modules to your
`node_modules` folder and adds the references to your `package.json` file, creating the file if it
doesn't already exist. For this example, you need only the Ika TypeScript SDK:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @ika-io/ika
```

Your `package.json` file now has a _dependencies_ section with `@ika-io/ika` listed with the package
version number.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@ika-io/ika": "^<VERSION_NUMBER>"
}
```

## Get some IKA for your account

Instead of a 'Hello World' output to your console, this example introduces some IKA to your wallet
address. You must be on Devnet, Testnet, or a local network to use a faucet for minting IKA.

Create a new `index.js` file in the root of your project with the following code.

```js
import { getFullnodeUrl, IkaClient } from '@ika-io/ika/client';
import { getFaucetHost, requestIkaFromFaucetV1 } from '@ika-io/ika/faucet';
import { NIKA_PER_IKA } from '@ika-io/ika/utils';

// replace <YOUR_IKA_ADDRESS> with your actual address, which is in the form 0x123...
const MY_ADDRESS = '<YOUR_IKA_ADDRESS>';

// create a new IkaClient object pointing to the network you want to use
const ikaClient = new IkaClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') });

// Convert NIKA to Ika
const balance = (balance) => {
	return Number.parseInt(balance.totalBalance) / Number(NIKA_PER_IKA);
};

// store the JSON representation for the IKA the address owns before using faucet
const ikaBefore = await ikaClient.getBalance({
	owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

await requestIkaFromFaucetV1({
	// use getFaucetHost to make sure you're using correct faucet address
	// you can also just use the address (see Ika TypeScript SDK Quick Start for values)
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// store the JSON representation for the IKA the address owns after using faucet
const ikaAfter = await ikaClient.getBalance({
	owner: MY_ADDRESS,
});

// Output result to console.
console.log(
	`Balance before faucet: ${balance(ikaBefore)} IKA. Balance after: ${balance(
		ikaAfter,
	)} IKA. Hello, IKA!`,
);
```

Save the file, then use Node.js to run it in your Console or Terminal:

```javascript
node index.js
```

The code imports the `requestIkaFromFaucetV1` function from the SDK and calls it to mint IKA for the
provided address. The code also imports `IkaClient` to create a new client on the Ika network that
it uses to query the address and output the amount of IKA the address owns before and after using
the faucet. You can check the total IKA for your address using the Ika Wallet or Ika Client CLI.

<Callout type="info">
	Faucets on Devnet and Testnet are rate limited. If you run the script too many times, you surpass
	the limit and must wait to successfully run it again.
</Callout>

You can also use the [Ika Client CLI](https://docs.ika.io/references/cli/client) to perform client
calls on a Ika network.
