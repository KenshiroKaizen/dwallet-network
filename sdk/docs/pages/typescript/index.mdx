# Ika TypeScript SDK Quick Start

The Ika TypeScript SDK is a modular library of tools for interacting with the Ika blockchain. Use it
to send queries to RPC nodes, build and sign transactions, and interact with a Ika or local network.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @ika-io/ika
```

## Network locations

The following table lists the locations for Ika networks.

| Network | Full node                             | faucet                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| local   | `http://127.0.0.1:9000` (default)     | `http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas` (default) |
| Devnet  | `https://fullnode.devnet.ika.io:443`  | `https://faucet.devnet.ika.io/gas`    |
| Testnet | `https://fullnode.testnet.ika.io:443` | `https://faucet.testnet.ika.io/gas`   |
| Mainnet | `https://fullnode.mainnet.ika.io:443` | `null`                                |

<Callout type="warning">

Use dedicated nodes/shared services rather than public endpoints for production apps. The public
endpoints maintained by Mysten Labs (`fullnode.<NETWORK>.ika.io:443`) are rate-limited, and support
only 100 requests per 30 seconds or so. Do not use public endpoints in production applications with
high traffic volume.

You can either run your own Full nodes, or outsource this to a professional infrastructure provider
(preferred for apps that have high traffic). You can find a list of reliable RPC endpoint providers
for Ika on the [Ika Dev Portal](https://ika.io/developers#dev-tools) using the **Node Service** tab.

## Migrate to version 0.38.0

The Ika TypeScript SDK was refactored beginning with version 0.38.0. If you are updating from an
earlier version of the SDK, there are some changes you should consider when updating your code.

### Module structure

The Ika TypeScript SDK is now divided into modular components. Before version 0.38.0, you imported
the complete SDK module. Now, you upload the individual packages of the SDK module instead. See the
[Module Packages section](#module-packages) for the list of packages.

### Deprecated classes

The Ika TypeScript SDK deprecates the following classes with version 0.38.0:

- `JsonRpcProvider` - The `JsonRpcProvider` class is deprecated in favor of the `ikaClient` class
  when creating a client for a Ika network. See
  [Network Interactions with IkaClient](typescript/ika-client) for more information.
- `SignerWithProver` and `RawSigner` - Key pairs now directly support signing transactions and
  messages without the need of a `Signer` class. See the
  [Key pairs](typescript/cryptography/keypairs) topic for more information.
- `signAndExecuteTransaction` - This method was not deprecated, but is now part of `IkaClient`.
- `Connection` classes - The `Connection` classes (`Connection`, `devnetConnection`, and so on) have
  been deprecated in favor of using `ikaClient` for establishing the connection. See
  [Network Interactions with IkaClient](typescript/ika-client) for more information.
- The `superstruct` type definitions for `JsonRPCProvider` types are replaced with generated types
  exported from `@ika-io/ika/client`. The new type definitions are pure TypeScript types that you
  can't use for runtime validation.
- A more stable JSON-RPC API has reduced the need for many of the SDK "getter" methods, which are
  now deprecated.

### Signing transactions

Signing and sending transactions changes slightly with the deprecation of the `Signer` pattern. For
an example of transaction signing, see the
[Ika Programmable Transaction Blocks Basics](typescript/transaction-building/basics) topic.

### Faucet requests

The ability to request IKA from a faucet is not part of `IkaClient` as it was with
`JsonRpcProvider`. Instead, you must use the `requestIkaFromFaucetV0` method from
`@ika-io/ika/faucet`. The `@ika-io/ika/faucet` import also provides a `getFaucetHost` method to
retrieve the faucet URL for `localnet`, `testnet`, or `devnet` networks.

```ts
import { getFaucetHost, requestIkaFromFaucetV0 } from '@ika-io/ika/faucet';

await requestIkaFromFaucetV0({
	host: getFaucetHost('devnet'),
	recipient: '<IKA_ADDRESS>',
});
```

## Module packages

The SDK contains a set of modular packages that you can use independently or together. Import just
what you need to keep your code light and compact.

- [`@ika-io/ika/client`](/typescript/ika-client) - A client for interacting with Ika RPC nodes.
- [`@ika-io/ika/bcs`](/typescript/bcs) - A BCS builder with pre-defined types for Ika.
- [`@ika-io/ika/transactions`](/typescript/transaction-building/basics) - Utilities for building and
  interacting with transactions.
- [`@ika-io/ika/keypairs/*`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs) - Modular exports for specific
  KeyPair implementations.
- [`@ika-io/ika/verify`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs#verifying-signatures-without-a-key-pair) -
  Methods for verifying transactions and messages.
- [`@ika-io/ika/cryptography`](/typescript/cryptography/keypairs) - Shared types and classes for
  cryptography.
- [`@ika-io/ika/multisig`](/typescript/cryptography/multisig) - Utilities for working with multisig
  signatures.
- [`@ika-io/ika/utils`](/typescript/utils) - Utilities for formatting and parsing various Ika types.
- [`@ika-io/ika/faucet`](/typescript/faucet) - Methods for requesting IKA from a faucet.
- [`@ika-io/ika/zklogin`](/typescript/zklogin) - Utilities for working with zkLogin. (Note
  @mysten/zklogin package also contains zklogin related functionality)
