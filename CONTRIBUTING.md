If you want to contribute code that creates a feature on Ika, start with a [Ika Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/ika-foundation/sips/tree/main) before developing the logic.

Found a bug or security vulnerability? Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new/choose). 

Found a small error or typo in the documentation? Each page on the [docs.ika.io](https://docs.ika.io/) site includes an **Edit this page** link at the bottom that you can use to edit the page in GitHub. The content is located in the docs/content directory of the Ika repo, so you can make a usual PR if you prefer. 

For larger documentation issues, you can [create an issue](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/issues/new/choose) in GitHub. To fix the problem yourself, follow the [documentation contribution](./docs/content/references/contribute/contribution-process.mdx) guidelines.
