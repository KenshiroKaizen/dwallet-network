# Future Transactions

The “Sign Future Transaction” feature on the dWallet Network introduces a way to enhance zero-trust interactions within the blockchain ecosystem. 

This feature allows users to secure DeFi interactions, such as loans and asset swaps, using their native assets without transferring ownership to a third party.
By ensuring that agreements are only completed when predefined conditions are met, users maintain control and security over their assets. 

The system offers transparency and verification through addresses and SPV light clients, allowing lenders to verify collateral easily and confidently. 

Additionally, the programmable nature of this feature, built on the Zero Trust Protocol (ZTP) infrastructure, supports secure operations across multiple blockchain networks, including EVM, Solana, and Cosmos. 
Designed for easy integration, it enables developers to build innovative and secure products, enhancing flexibility and security without compromising the sovereignty of individual blockchains.
