The native asset on Ika is called IKA. The coin uses the capitalized version of IKA to distinguish the coin from the Ika network.

The total supply of IKA is capped at **10,000,000,000** (ten billion coins). A share of IKA total supply became liquid at Mainnet launch, with the remaining coins vesting over the coming years, or distributed as future stake reward subsidies.

The IKA coin serves four purposes on the Ika network:

- You can stake IKA to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism.
- IKA is the asset denomination needed to pay the gas fees required to execute and store transactions or other operations on the Ika network.
- You can use IKA as a versatile and liquid asset for various applications, including the standard features of money - a unit of account, a medium of exchange, or a store of value - and more complex functionality smart contracts enable, interoperability, and composability across the Ika ecosystem.
- IKA coins play an important role in governance by acting as a right to participate in on-chain voting on issues such as protocol upgrades.

There is a finite supply of IKA. The balance must support all economic activities to scale as more and more people migrate to the Ika platform. In addition, the presence of a storage fund creates important monetary dynamics, in that higher on-chain data requirements translate into a larger storage fund, reducing the amount of IKA in circulation.
