title: Ika Architecture
---

Ika shares some similarities with other blockchains but is unique in many ways. Use the topics in this section to understand the features that define the Ika network.

## Understand Ika Security

Learn about the mechanisms available to secure on-chain assets, and the assurances Ika provides regarding asset security. Understand Ika Security explores the overall Ika security architecture to ensure the asset types you design leverage Ika to provide a secure experience for asset holders.

Go to [Understand Ika Security](./ika-architecture/ika-security.mdx).

## Life of a Transaction

Life of a Transaction details the transitions that all transactions on Ika go through from creation to finality. This topic also explores some features of the blockchain (like epochs and checkpoints) that play a role in the life of a transaction.

Go to [Life of a Transaction](./ika-architecture/transaction-lifecycle.mdx).

## Consensus

Every transaction on Ika is sequenced by consensus, where validators agree to the same order of execution of the transactions, even if a minority of them are down or are malicious actors that want to harm the network and users.
Ika currently uses the [Mysticeti](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.14821) consensus algorithm.

Go to [Consensus](./ika-architecture/consensus.mdx).

## Ika Indexer

Running a Ika indexer offloads data processing from your Full node and stores it in a relational database. This topic explores some of the benefits running an indexer has and points to instruction on how to run your own. 

Go to [Ika Indexer](./ika-architecture/indexer-functions.mdx).

## Protocol Upgrades

The Ika protocol, framework, and execution engine are frequently extended to include new functionality and bug fixes. This functionality is added in the form of new code which is released to validator operators as part of our regular software releases. The Ika protocol, however, requires that all Ika validators agree about the results of executing each transaction.
