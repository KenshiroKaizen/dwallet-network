## Check Ika CLI installation

Before you can use the Ika CLI, you must install it. To check if the CLI exists on your system, open a terminal or console and type the following command:

```shell
ika --version
```

If the terminal or console responds with a version number, you already have the Ika CLI installed.

If the command is not found, follow the instructions in [Install Ika](/guides/developer/getting-started/ika-install.mdx) to get the Ika CLI on your system.
