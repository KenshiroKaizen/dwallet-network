See [Publish a Package](/guides/developer/first-app/publish.mdx) for a more detailed guide on publishing packages or [Ika Client CLI](/references/cli/client.mdx) for a complete reference of `client` commands in the Ika CLI.

:::

Before publishing your code, you must first initialize the Ika Client CLI, if you haven't already. To do so, in a terminal or console at the root directory of the project enter `ika client`. If you receive the following response, complete the remaining instructions:

```
Config file ["<FILE-PATH>/.ika/ika_config/client.yaml"] doesn't exist, do you want to connect to a Ika Full node server [y/N]?
```

Enter `y` to proceed. You receive the following response:

```
Ika Full node server URL (Defaults to Ika Testnet if not specified) :
```

Leave this blank (press Enter). You receive the following response:

```
Select key scheme to generate keypair (0 for ed25519, 1 for secp256k1, 2: for secp256r1):
```

Select `0`. Now you should have a Ika address set up.
