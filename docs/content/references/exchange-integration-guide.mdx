This topic describes how to integrate IKA, the token native to the Ika network, into a cryptocurrency exchange. The specific requirements and processes to implement an integration vary between exchanges. Rather than provide a step-by-step guide, this topic provides information about the primary tasks necessary to complete an integration. After the guidance about how to configure an integration, you can also find information and code samples related to staking on the Ika network.

## Requirements to configure a IKA integration {#requirements-ika-integration}

The requirements to configure a IKA integration include:

- A Ika Full node. You can operate your own Ika Full node or use a Full node from a node operator.
- Suggested minimum hardware to run a Ika Full node:
  - CPUs: 8 physical cores / 16 vCPUs
  - RAM: 128 GB
  - Storage (SSD): 4 TB NVMe drive

For best results, run Ika Full nodes on Linux. Ika supports the Ubuntu and Debian distributions. You can also fun a Full node on macOS.

## Configure a Ika Full node {#configure-full-node}

You can set up and configure a Ika Full node using Docker or directly from source code in the Ika GitHub repository.

### Install a Ika Full node using Docker {#full-node-docker}

Run the command in this section using the same branch of the repository for each. Replace `branch-name` with the branch you use. For example, use `devnet` to use the Ika Devnet network, or use `testnet` to use the Ika Testnet network. You must download all files to, and run all commands from, the same folder location.

1.  Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Docker Desktop version installs Docker Compose.
1.  Install dependencies for Linux:
    ```bash
    apt update \
    && apt install -y --no-install-recommends \
    tzdata \
    ca-certificates \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    cmake
    ```
1.  Download the docker-compose.yaml file:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/branch-name/docker/fullnode/docker-compose.yaml
    ```
1.  Download the fullnode-template.yaml file:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/raw/branch-name/crates/ika-config/data/fullnode-template.yaml
    ```
1.  Download the genesis.blob file:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/branch-name/genesis.blob
    ```
1.  Start the Full node. The -d switch starts it in the background (detached mode).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Install a Ika Full node from source {#install-full-node-source}

Use the steps in this section to install and configure a Ika Full node directly from the Ika GitHub repository. These steps use [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), the Rust package manager.

1.  Install prerequisites for Ika.
1.  Clone the Ika repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git -b branch-name
    ```
    Replace `branch-name` with the branch to use. You should use the same branch for all commands.
1.  Change directories to /ika:
    ```bash
    cd ika
    ```
1.  Copy the fullnode.yaml template:
    ```bash
    cp crates/ika-config/data/fullnode-template.yaml fullnode.yaml
    ```
1.  Download the genesis.blob file:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui-genesis/raw/main/branch-name/genesis.blob
    ```
    Change branch-name to the same branch you used for previous commands.
1.  Optionally, if you installed Ika to a path other than the default, modify the fullnode.yaml file to use the path you used. Update the path to the folder where you installed ika-fullnode for the `db-path` and `genesis-file-location` as appropriate:
    `db-path: "/db-files/ika-fullnode-folder"`
    `genesis-file-location: "/ika-fullnode-folder/genesis.blob"`
1.  Start you Ika Full node:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release --bin ika-node -- --config-path fullnode.yaml
    ```

## Set up Ika addresses {#setup-ika-addresses}

Ika addresses do not require on-chain initialization, you can spend from an address if it corresponds to your private key. You can derive a 32-byte Ika address by hashing the signature scheme flag byte concatenated with public key bytes `flag || pubkey` using the [BLAKE2b](https://www.blake2.net/) (256 bits output) hashing function.

Currently, Ika address supports these signature schemes: pure Ed25519, Secp256k1, Secp256r1 and Multisig. The corresponding flag bytes are 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 respectively.

The following code sample demonstrates how to derive a Ika address in Rust:

```rust
let flag = 0x00; // 0x00 = ED25519, 0x01 = Secp256k1, 0x02 = Secp256r1, 0x03 = MultiSig
// Hash the [flag, public key] bytearray using Blake2b
let mut hasher = DefaultHash::default();
hasher.update([flag]);
hasher.update(pk);
let arr = hasher.finalize();
let ika_address_string = hex::encode(arr);
```

## Displaying addresses {#displaying-addresses}

Ika supports both addresses with and without a 0x prefix. Ika recommends that you always include the 0x prefix in API calls and when you display user addresses.

## Track balance changes for an address {#track-balance-changes}

You can track balance changes by calling `ika_getBalance` at predefined intervals. This call returns the total balance for an address. The total includes any coin or token type, but this document focuses on IKA. You can track changes in the total balance for an address between subsequent `ika_getBalance` requests.

The following bash example demonstrates how to use `ika_getBalance` for address 0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3. If you use a network other than Devnet, replace the value for `rpc` with the URL to the appropriate Full node.

```bash
rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.ika.io:443"
address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"
data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"ika_getBalance\", \"id\": 1, \"params\": [\"$address\"]}"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response is a JSON object that includes the totalBalance for the address:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "coinType": "0x2::ika::IKA",
    "coinObjectCount": 40,
    "totalBalance": 10000000000,
    "lockedBalance": {}
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

The following example demonstrates using ika_getBalance in Rust:

```rust
use std::str::FromStr;
use ika_sdk::types::base_types::IkaAddress;
use ika_sdk::{IkaClient, IkaClientBuilder};


#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), anyhow::Error> {
   let ika = IkaClientBuilder::default().build(
      "https://fullnode.devnet.ika.io:443",
   ).await.unwrap();
   let address = IkaAddress::from_str("0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3")?;
   let objects = ika.read_api().get_balance(address).await?;
   println!("{:?}", objects);
   Ok(())
}
```

## Use events to track balance changes for an address {#events-balance-changes}

You can also track the balance for an address by subscribing to all of the events emitted from it. Use a filter to include only the events related to IKA coins, such as when the address acquires a coin or pays for a gas fee.
The following example demonstrates how to filter events for an address using bash and cURL:

```bash
rpc="https://fullnode.devnet.ika.io:443"
address="0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3"
data="{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\":1, \"method\": \"ika_getEvents\", \"params\": [{\"Recipient\": {\"AddressOwner\": \"0x849d63687330447431a2e76fecca4f3c10f6884ebaa9909674123c6c662612a3\"}}, null, null, true ]}"
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' --data-raw "$data" $rpc
```

The response can include a large number of events. Add pagination to the response using the `nextCursor` key in the request. You can determine the corresponding `txDigest` and `eventSeq` from the `id` field of a transaction.

You can add the `txDigest` value instead of the first `null` within the `params`. The second `null` is an integer that defines how many results (up to 1000) to return and the `true` means ascending order. You can use the `nextCursor` so the response starts from a desired point.

The `id` field of any transaction looks like:

```bash
"id": {
         "txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2",
         "eventSeq": 6019
       }
```

With this data, create a nextCursor as follows:

```bash
nextCursor : {"txDigest": "GZQN9pE3Zr9ZfLzBK1BfVCXtbjx5xKMxPSEKaHDvL3E2","eventSeq": 6019}
```

## Blocks vs Checkpoints {#blocks-vs-checkpoints}

Ika is a DAG-based blockchain and uses checkpoints for node synchronization and global transaction ordering. Checkpoints differ from blocks in the following ways:

- Ika creates checkpoints and adds finalized transactions. Note that transactions are finalized even before they are included in a checkpoint
- Checkpoints do not fork, roll back, or reorganize.
- Ika creates about four checkpoints every second. Find the most up-to-date statistic on the [Ika public dashboard](https://metrics.ika.io/public-dashboards/4ceb11cc210d4025b122294586961169).

### Checkpoint API operations {#checkpoint-api-operations}

Ika Checkpoint API operations include:

- [ika_getCheckpoint](/ika-api-ref#ika_getCheckpoint) - Retrieves the specified checkpoint.
- [ika_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber](/ika-api-ref#ika_getLatestCheckpointSequenceNumber) - Retrieves the sequence number of the most recently executed checkpoint.
- ika_getCheckpoints - Retrieves a paginated list of checkpoints that occurred during the specified interval. Pending a future release.

## IKA Balance transfer {#ika-balance-transfer}

To transfer a specific amount of IKA between addresses, you need a IKA token object with that specific value. In Ika, everything is an object, including IKA tokens. The amount of IKA in each IKA token object varies. For example, an address could own 3 IKA tokens with different values: one of 0.1 IKA, a second of 1.0 IKA, and a third with 0.005 IKA. The total balance for the address equals the sum of the values of the individual IKA token objects, in this case, 1.105 IKA.

You can merge and split IKA token objects to create token objects with specific values. To create a IKA token worth .6 IKA, split the token worth 1 IKA into two token objects worth .6 IKA and .4 IKA.

To transfer a specific amount of IKA, you need a IKA token worth that specific amount. To get a IKA token with that specific value, you might need to split or merge existing IKA tokens. Ika supports several methods to accomplish this, including some that do not require you to manually split or merge coins.

## Ika API operations for transfers {#api-operations-transfers}

Ika supports the following API operations related to transferring IKA between addresses:

- [ika_transferObject](/ika-api-ref#ika_transferObject)
  Because IKA tokens are objects, you can transfer IKA tokens just like any other object. This method requires a gas token, and is useful in niche cases only.

- [ika_payAllIka](/ika-api-ref#ika_payAllIka)
  This method accepts an array of IKA token IDs. It merges all existing tokens into one, deducts the gas fee, then sends the merged token to the recipient address.

  The method is especially useful if you want to transfer all IKA from an address. To merge together all coins for an address, set the recipient as the same address. This is a native Ika method so is not considered a transaction in Ika.

- [ika_payIka](/ika-api-ref#ika_payIka)
  This operation accepts an array of IKA token IDs, an array of amounts, and an array of recipient addresses.

  The amounts and recipients array map one to one. Even if you use only one recipient address, you must include it for each amount in the amount array.

  The operation merges all of the tokens provided into one token object and settles the gas fees. It then splits the token according to the amounts in the amounts array and sends the first token to the first recipient, the second token to the second recipient, and so on. Any remaining IKA on the token stays in the source address.

  The benefits of this method include: no gas fees for merging or splitting tokens, and the abstracted token merge and split. The `ika_payIka` operation is a native function, so the merge and split operations are not considered Ika transactions. The gas fees for them match typical transactions on Ika.You can use this operation to split coins in your own address by setting the recipient as your own address. Note that the total value of the input coins must be greater than the total value of the amounts to send.

- [ika_pay](/ika-api-ref#ika_pay)
  This method is similar to ika_payIka, but it accepts any kind of coin or token instead of only IKA. You must include a gas token, and all of the coins or tokens must be the same type.

- [ika_transferIka](/ika-api-ref#ika_transferIka)
  This method accepts only one IKA token object and an amount to send to the recipient. It uses the same token for gas fees, so the amount to transfer must be strictly less than the value of the IKA token used.

## Signing Transactions {#signing-transactions}

Please refer to Ika Signatures for more details on signature validity requirements.

## IKA Staking {#ika-staking}

The Ika blockchain uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism (DPoS). This allows IKA token holders to stake their IKA tokens to any validator of their choice. When someone stakes their IKA tokens, it means those tokens are locked for the entire epoch. Users can withdraw their stake at any time, but new staking requests become active only at the start of the next epoch.

IKA holders who stake their tokens to validators earn rewards for helping secure the Ika network. Ika determines rewards for staking based on stake rewards on the network, and distributes them at the end of each epoch.

The total voting power in the Ika Network is always 10,000. The voting power of each individual validator is similar to basis points. For example, a voting power of 101 = 1.01%. Ika's quorum threshold (number of votes needed to confirm a transaction) is 6,667 (which is greater than 2/3). The voting power for a single validator is capped at 1,000 (10%) regardless of how much stake the validator has.

## Staking functions {#staking-functions}

Ika supports the following API operations related to staking. You can find the source code in the [ika_system](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/blob/main/crates/ika-framework/packages/ika-system/sources/ika_system.move) module.

- `request_add_stake`
  Add user stake to a validator's staking pool.

```move
public fun request_add_stake(
   self: &mut IkaSystemState,
   stake: Coin<IKA>,
   validator_address: address,
   ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
   validator_set::request_add_stake(
       &mut self.validators,
       validator_address,
       coin::into_balance(stake),
       option::none(),
       ctx,
   );
}
```

- `request_add_stake_mul_coin`
  Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using multiple coins.

```move
public fun request_add_stake_mul_coin(
   self: &mut IkaSystemState,
   delegate_stakes: vector<Coin<IKA>>,
   stake_amount: option::Option<u64>,
   validator_address: address,
   ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
   let balance = extract_coin_balance(delegate_stakes, stake_amount, ctx);
   validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::none(), ctx);
}
```

- `request_add_stake_with_locked_coin`
  Add user stake to a validator's staking pool using a locked IKA coin.

```move
public fun request_add_stake_with_locked_coin(
   self: &mut IkaSystemState,
   stake: LockedCoin<IKA>,
   validator_address: address,
   ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
   let (balance, lock) = locked_coin::into_balance(stake);
   validator_set::request_add_stake(&mut self.validators, validator_address, balance, option::some(lock), ctx);
}
```

- `request_withdraw_stake`
  Withdraw some portion of a user stake from a validator's staking pool.

```move
public fun request_withdraw_stake(
   self: &mut IkaSystemState,
   delegation: &mut Delegation,
   staked_ika: &mut StakedIka,
   principal_withdraw_amount: u64,
   ctx: &mut TxContext,
) {
   validator_set::request_withdraw_stake(
       &mut self.validators,
       delegation,
       staked_ika,
       principal_withdraw_amount,
       ctx,
   );
}
```
