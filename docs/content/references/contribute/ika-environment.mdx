title: Ika Environment Setup
description: Get the background information you need before you start developing on Ika. Learn the layout of the Ika monorepository and the suggested development environment for working with Move.
---

Before you start developing with Ika and Move, you should familiarize yourself with how to contribute to Ika, how Ika is structured, what tools and SDKs exist, and what plugins are available to use in your IDE.

## Fork the Ika repository {#fork}

The recommended way to contribute to the Ika repository is to fork the project, make changes on your fork, then submit a pull request (PR). The Ika repository is available on GitHub: https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.

To create a local Ika repository:

1. Go to the [Ika repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui) on GitHub.
1. Click the **Fork** button to create a copy of the repository in your account.

    ![Fork Ika repo](./images/fork.png)

1. In your forked repository on GitHub, click the green `Code <>` button and copy the **HTTPS** URL GitHub provides.

    ![Copy URL](./images/gh-url.png)

1. Open a terminal or console on your system at the location you want to save the repository locally. Type `git clone ` and paste the URL you copied in the previous step and press `Enter`.
1. Type `cd ika` to make `ika` the active directory.

You can use any [branching strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) you prefer on your Ika fork. Make your changes locally and push to your repository, submitting PRs to the official Ika repository from your fork as needed.

:::tip

Be sure to synchronize your fork frequently to keep it up-to-date with active development.

## Ika repository and how to contribute

The Ika repo is a monorepo, containing all the source code that is used to build and run the Ika network, as well as this documentation.

The root folder of the Ika monorepo has the following top-level folders:

- [apps](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/apps): Contains the source code for the main web applications that Mysten Labs runs, `Ika Wallet`.
- [consensus](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/consensus): Contains the source code of consensus.
- [crates](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates): Contains all the Rust crates that are part of the Ika system.
- [dapps](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/dapps): Contains some examples of decentralized applications built on top of Ika, such as Kiosk or Sponsored Transactions.
- [dashboards](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/dashboards): Currently empty.

## Development branches

The Ika repository includes four primary branches: `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, and `main`.

The `devnet` branch includes the latest stable build of Ika. Choose the `devnet` branch if you want to build or test on Ika Devnet. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the `main` branch. To submit a PR, you should push commits to your fork of the `main` branch.

The `testnet` branch includes the code running on the Ika Testnet network.

The `mainnet` branch includes the code running on the Ika Mainnet network.

The `main` branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the `main` branch if you want to contribute to the Ika project or to experiment with cutting-edge functionality. The `main` branch might include unreleased changes and experimental features, so use it at your own risk.
