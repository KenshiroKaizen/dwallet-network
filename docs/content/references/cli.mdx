Ika provides a command line interface (CLI) tool to interact with the Ika network, its features, and the Move programming language. The complete ikate of tools is called the Ika CLI, with commands grouped together by feature. Each group of commands is commonly referred to by its top-level command: Ika Client CLI, Ika Console CLI, Ika Keytool CLI, Ika Move CLI, and Ika Validator CLI.

## Update CLI

To get the latest version of the CLI, you can run the following command from a terminal or console. Be sure to replace `<BRANCH-NAME>` with `main`, `devnet`, `testnet`, or `mainnet` to get the desired version. For more information on the branches available, see [Ika Environment Setup](./contribute/ika-environment.mdx).

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch <BRANCH-NAME> --features tracing ika
```

:::info

The `tracing` feature is important as it adds Move test coverage and debugger support in the Ika CLI. Unless it is enabled you will not be able to use these two features.
