title: Client App with Ika TypeScript SDK
---

This exercise diverges from the example built in the previous topics in this section. Rather than adding a frontend to the running example, the instruction walks you through setting up dApp Kit in a React App, allowing you to connect to wallets, and query data from Ika RPC nodes to display in your app. You can use it to create your own frontend for the example used previously, but if you want to get a fully functional app up and running quickly, run the following command in a terminal or console to scaffold a new app with all steps in this exercise already implemented:

{@include: ../../../snippets/info-pnpm-required.mdx}

```bash
pnpm create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
```

or

```bash
yarn create @mysten/dapp --template react-client-dapp
```

## What is the Ika TypeScript SDK?

The Ika TypeScript SDK (@ika-io/ika) provides all the low-level functionality needed to interact with Ika ecosystem from TypeScript. You can use it in any TypeScript or JavaScript project, including web apps, Node.js apps, or mobile apps written with tools like React Native that support TypeScript.

For more information on the Ika TypeScript SDK, see the [Ika TypeScript SDK documentation](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript).

## What is dApp Kit?

dApp Kit (@mysten/dapp-kit) is a collection of React hooks, components, and utilities that make building dApps on Ika straightforward. For more information on dApp Kit, see the [dApp Kit documentation](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit).

## Installing dependencies

To get started, you need a React app. The following steps apply to any React, so you can follow the same steps to add dApp Kit to an existing React app. If you are starting a new project, you can use Vite to scaffold a new React app.

Run the following command in your terminal or console, and select React as the framework, and then select one of the TypeScript templates:

```bash npm2yarn
npm init vite
```

Now that you have a React app, you can install the necessary dependencies to use dApp Kit:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @ika-io/ika @mysten/dapp-kit @tanstack/react-query
```

## Setting up Provider components

To use all the features of dApp Kit, wrap your app with a couple of `Provider` components.

Open the root component that renders your app (the default location the Vite template uses is `src/main.tsx`) and integrate or replace the current code with the following.

The first `Provider` to set up is the `QueryClientProvider` from `@tanstack/react-query`. This `Provider` manages request state for various hooks in dApp kit. If you're already using `@tanstack/react-query`, dApp Kit can share the same `QueryClient` instance.

```ts
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
			<App />
		</QueryClientProvider>
	</React.StrictMode>,
);
```

Next, set up the `IkaClientProvider`. This `Provider` delivers a `IkaClient` instance from `@ika-io/ika` to all the hooks in dApp Kit. This provider manages which network dApp Kit connects to, and can accept configuration for multiple networks. This exercise connects to `devnet`.

```ts
import { IkaClientProvider } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
import { getFullnodeUrl } from '@ika-io/ika/client';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
const networks = {
	devnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') },
	mainnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet') },
};

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
			<IkaClientProvider networks={networks} defaultNetwork="devnet">
				<App />
			</IkaClientProvider>
		</QueryClientProvider>
	</React.StrictMode>,
);
```

Finally, set up the `WalletProvider` from `@mysten/dapp-kit`, and import styles for the `dapp-kit` components.

```ts
import '@mysten/dapp-kit/dist/index.css';

import { IkaClientProvider, WalletProvider } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
import { getFullnodeUrl } from '@ika-io/ika/client';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
const networks = {
	devnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') },
	mainnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet') },
};

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
			<IkaClientProvider networks={networks} defaultNetwork="devnet">
				<WalletProvider>
					<App />
				</WalletProvider>
			</IkaClientProvider>
		</QueryClientProvider>
	</React.StrictMode>,
);
```

## Connecting to a wallet

With all `Providers` set up, you can use dApp Kit hooks and components. To allow users to connect their wallets to your dApp, add a `ConnectButton`.

```ts
import { ConnectButton } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';

function App() {
	return (
		<div className="App">
			<header className="App-header">
				<ConnectButton />
			</header>
		</div>
	);
}
```

The `ConnectButton` component displays a button that opens a modal on click, enabling the user to connect their wallet. Upon connection, it displays their address, and provides the option to disconnect.

## Getting the connected wallet address

Now that you have a way for users to connect their wallets, you can start using the `useCurrentAccount` hook to get details about the connected wallet account.

```ts
import { ConnectButton, useCurrentAccount } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';

function App() {
	return (
		<div className="App">
			<header className="App-header">
				<ConnectButton />
			</header>

			<ConnectedAccount />
		</div>
	);
}

function ConnectedAccount() {
	const account = useCurrentAccount();

	if (!account) {
		return null;
	}

	return <div>Connected to {account.address}</div>;
}
```

## Querying data from Ika RPC nodes

Now that you have the account to connect to, you can query for objects the connected account owns:

```ts
import { useCurrentAccount, useIkaClientQuery } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';

function ConnectedAccount() {
	const account = useCurrentAccount();

	if (!account) {
		return null;
	}

	return (
		<div>
			<div>Connected to {account.address}</div>;
			<OwnedObjects address={account.address} />
		</div>
	);
}

function OwnedObjects({ address }: { address: string }) {
	const { data } = useIkaClientQuery('getOwnedObjects', {
		owner: address,
	});
	if (!data) {
		return null;
	}

	return (
		<ul>
			{data.data.map((object) => (
				<li key={object.data?.objectId}>
					<a href={`https://example-explorer.com/object/${object.data?.objectId}`}>
						{object.data?.objectId}
					</a>
				</li>
			))}
		</ul>
	);
}
```

You now have a dApp connected to wallets and can query data from RPC nodes.
