title: Get Ika Address
description: You need an address on the Ika network before you can start trading NFTs, purchase IKA tokens, or perform other transactions.

An address is a way to uniquely and anonymously identify an account that exists on the Ika blockchain network. In other words, an address is a way for a user to store and use tokens on the Ika network, without providing any personally identifying information (such as email address, phone number, and so on). For example, if you want to purchase a number of IKA tokens to play a game, you must specify an address where these tokens are to be deposited.

The Ika address is unique, similarly to the way a social security number or a personal identification number is unique to one person. However, in Ika you can create and own multiple addresses, all of which are unique. 

In Ika, an address is 32 bytes and is often encoded in hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix. For example, this is a valid Ika address: `0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331`. You can use a Ika network explorer to find more information about this address and the objects it owns.

If you'd like to understand how a Ika address is derived from private keys and other cryptography related topics, see the [Keys and Addresses](/concepts/cryptography/transaction-auth/keys-addresses.mdx) topic.


## How to obtain a Ika address

Ika provides multiple ways to obtain a Ika address. The following are the two most common. 

### Ika Wallet

One of the most straightforward ways to obtain a Ika address for first-time users is through the [Ika Wallet Chrome browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ika-wallet/opcgpfmipidbgpenhmajoajpbobppdil). After you install the extension, there are several ways to create an address. 

Open the Chrome Ika Wallet browser extension and then:
- Use your gmail/twitch/facebook account (ZkLogin) and follow the on-screen instructions
- Click **More Options** â†’ **Create a new passphrase account**. Then follow the on-screen instructions. 

For more information on the Ika Wallet and how to keep it secure, see the [Ika Wallet documentation](https://mysten-docs-site.vercel.app/wallet). 

### Command line interface

If you are using the Ika command line interface (CLI) to interact with the Ika network, you can use the `ika client` command to generate a new address. By default, when the Ika CLI runs for the first time it will prompt you to set up your local wallet, and then it generates one Ika address and the associated secret recovery phrase. Make sure you write down the secret recovery phrase and store it in a safe place. 


To generate a new Ika address use `ika client new-address ed25519`, which specifies the keypair scheme flag to be of type `ed25519`.

For more information, see the [Ika Client CLI](../../../references/cli/client.mdx) documentation.

To see all the generated addresses in the local wallet on your machine, run `ika keytool list`. For more information about the keytool options, see the [Ika Keytool CLI](../../../references/cli/keytool.mdx) documentation.

:::danger

The private keys associated with the Ika addresses are stored locally on the machine where the CLI is installed, in the `~/.ika/ika_config/ika.keystore` file. Make sure you do not expose this to anyone, as they can use it to get access to your account.
